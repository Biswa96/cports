Subject: [PATCH 29/29] libcxx: default to type 2

// This implementation of type_info does not assume there is always a unique
// copy of the RTTI for a given type inside a program. For various reasons
// the linker may have failed to merge every copy of a types RTTI
// (For example: -Bsymbolic or llvm.org/PR37398). Under this assumption, two
// type_infos are equal if their addresses are equal or if a deep string
// comparison is equal.

this is mostly for compat with libstdc++, which some projects
like kde* rely on:
